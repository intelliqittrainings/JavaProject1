Git uses three sections on the local machine
1 Working directory or workspace
2 Stagging Area
3 Local Repository

Working directory is the folder where the developer creates all the
code.The files created in this folder are initially called as 
"Untracked files"

Stagging Area is the intermediate buffer zone into which files move
from the working directory.These files are called stagged files

Local Repository is where version controlling happens and all the
files from stagging area move into local repository.These files are called
as commited files
